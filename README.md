# LEGO-MINDSTORMS-TETRIX
Robotic Engineering - Mini Project 

# Aim of the Project 
	The Robot is programmed in such a way that it avoids the obstacles such as walls, objects, etc. in its way, by taking the required direction to reach its destination with 
the help of ultrasonic sensor. Once the light sensor recognises the red line(destination), the robot stops moving. Now, the ultrasonic sensors attached to servo motor rotates for 
about 180 degrees with an increment of 5 degrees each and measures the distance between the robot and the objects placed in front of them and displays that measured distance on 
the display of the Nxt controller. All this is achieved with the help of the hardware comprising of Lego Mindstorm kit and Tetrix Kit and mainly with the help of programming in 
Robot C langauge.

# HARDWARE DESCRIPTION: 
Lego Mindstorm and the Tetrix are the following kits used to build this model.
